# Timesheet Autofill Tool
The Timesheet Autofill Tool has been developed to streamline the process of completing Pegasys and Deltek timesheets by automatically populating them with relevant data from the Conservancy's official Deltek system. Since all N4W staff members at The Nature Conservancy are required to fill out Deltek and Pegasys timesheets on a monthly basis, this tool is designed to save time, reduce manual entry, and minimize errors. Leveraging Python, the tool simplifies the timekeeping process, ensuring that key information from Deltek is efficiently transferred to Pegasys.
