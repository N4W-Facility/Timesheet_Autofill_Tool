# Timesheet Autofill Tool
The Timesheet Autofill Tool is designed to optimize the completion of N4W-Facility and TNC timesheets by automatically integrating meeting details from the Outlook calendar. This ensures alignment and consistency across The Nature Conservancy's official systems, Deltek and N4W-Facility. Given that all N4W staff at The Nature Conservancy are mandated to submit monthly timesheets in both systems, this tool significantly reduces manual input, minimizes errors, and enhances efficiency. Developed using Python, the tool streamlines the timekeeping process while ensuring the accuracy and synchronization of data between Deltek and N4W-Facility.
